The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to Firebase's Realtime Database security rules, specifically when dealing with nested data and custom functions within the rules.

```javascript
// Security rules
rules_version = '2';

// This function is meant to check if a user is an admin
isAdmin(auth) {
  return auth.uid == "adminUserId";
}

// Data structure
// users: {
//   uid1: {
//     name: "User 1",
//     admin: false
//   },
//   uid2: {
//     name: "User 2",
//     admin: true
//   }
// }

// read access to the entire database
match /databases/{database}/documents { 
  allow read: if isAdmin(auth) || get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(auth.uid)).data.admin == true; 
  allow write: if isAdmin(auth);
}
```
This rule intends to allow users to read their own data if their `admin` field is true, or if the `isAdmin` function returns true. The problem lies in the combination of the `get()` call within the `allow` statement and the condition.  `get()` is asynchronous, meaning the rule might evaluate the `isAdmin()` check before the `get()` resolves. This can lead to unexpected permission behaviors or inconsistent results depending on the timing of the operation. In some cases, users might have temporary read access due to other parts of the rule resolving sooner.
