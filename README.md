# Firebase Security Rules: Asynchronous get() Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to asynchronous operations within Firebase Realtime Database security rules.  The problem arises from using `get()` within an `allow` statement, leading to inconsistent permission behavior.

## Problem
The security rules use `get()` to fetch a user's data to determine read access.  Because `get()` is asynchronous, the `allow` statement may evaluate prematurely, leading to unexpected permissions.  This is especially problematic because the rules can vary in their evaluation time based on different conditions and server load.

## Solution
The solution involves refactoring the rules to avoid using `get()` within the `allow` statement.  Instead, we'll restructure the data or use different techniques that do not require asynchronous operations in the rules themselves.
